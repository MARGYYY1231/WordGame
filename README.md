- A word game where given the starting letter the user has five attempts to guess a four or five letter word. This was inspired by a game called lingo. But this game does not have a timer like lingo has so there is no need to hurry :)
- If the letter is green then the letter in the correct postion
- If the letter is yellow then the word contains the letter but it is in the wrong place

 **What was the hardest part of making the word game?**
-  The hardest part was to do the conditions for the to color the letter yellow for if the word contains it. For example it the word was lone and the user enters loop then one of the o's in loop would turn green and the other would turn yellow. So I compared the number of each letter in the entered word and the answer beforehand and if the entered word has more I would get the index of each occurence of the letter and check if any of those are in the right position. If it is turn green other wise orange. Then when same amount of chacter every other occurance of the letter would stay blue.

**What is the most interesting part of the game?**
- The most interesting part of the game is guessing the word based on the words that you have guesses before.
